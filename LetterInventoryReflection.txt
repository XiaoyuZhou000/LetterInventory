Assesement 1: LetterInventory Reflection

1) What did you learn from working on this 
assignment?
I can use this() to call the current method. Also, method can be
called in other method is a new way let me to approach my purpose.

2) What did you struggle most with on this 
assignment? How did you work to overcome 
that struggle (even if you weren't able to)?
How to appropriately use ASCII index for character struggle me at
first. I solved this by using hints in the specification and the 
example code from other coding website.

3) How will you use what you learned from 
this assignment to improve your process or 
approach on future assignments?
It is important to have a structure and purpose before doing actual coding.
I should have this good habit before every coding project.

4) Was any part of the specification or 
requirements unclear? If so, what part(s), 
and how could it have been made clearer?
What are the methods we have to include in the assessment, such as helper methods?

5) About how many hours did you spend working 
on this assignment? (Estimates are fine, but 
try to get close)
3 hours for coding. 1 hour for commenting.
